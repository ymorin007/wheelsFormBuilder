#### Git Workflow

The git repo's **_develop_ branch** is used as the primary development branch. The _master_ branch will always be the current stable release. When finalizing a release, a release branch will be used (e.g., _release-0.99_). The Git workflow employed for formBuilder development is nicely detailed in this blog series, by Bob Silverberg, [A Git Workflow for Open Source Collaboration](http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/Git-Workflow):
